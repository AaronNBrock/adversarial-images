# Adversarial Images

---

The goal of this project is to create a general attack that can be used to generate images that a given neural network will mis classify.



#### Step one: Use example Project

The first part of this project will to find an example of an adversarial attack done on a network and see if we can reproduce the results and get our hands dirty with playing around with it.

[Example Adversarial Attack](https://github.com/jasonicarter/MNIST-adversarial-images)


#### Step Two: Recreate results on different network

Using the attack found in step one create an attack for a different network than the one in the example.  Something simple to try it on would be my [MNIST-Simple](https://github.com/AaronNBrock/mnist-examples/blob/master/MNIST-Simple.ipynb) workbook.
